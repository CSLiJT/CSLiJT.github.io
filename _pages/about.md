I am a master's student major in data science at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/). I received my bachelor's degree in data science at USTC in 2022. My research interest includes trustworthy ML, LLM, and educational data mining. 

Previously, I was fortunated to work with Dr. [Mengxiao Zhu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~mxzhu/) at USTC, Dr. [Xiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rxT-92AAAAAJ) at [Educational Testing Service](https://www.ets.org/), Dr. [Renjun Hu](https://hurenjun.github.io/) at Alibaba Cloud, and Dr. [Yifei Yuan](https://yfyuan01.github.io/) at University of Copenhagen.

I am seeking a PhD position for the Fall 2025 semester.
