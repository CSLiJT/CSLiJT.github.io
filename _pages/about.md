I am Jiatong Li. I got my bachelor's degree in data science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I expect to obtain my master's degree in data science at USTC in 2025. My research interest includes trustworthy ML, LLM, and educational data mining. I am seeking a PhD position for the Fall 2025 semester.
